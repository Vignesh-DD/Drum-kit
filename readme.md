Hey there..

This is Drum-kit web app designed using JavaScript.

So the way this website would work that we’ve got a number of keys on the webpage that represents different drums in a typical drum set and when user click on any of those buttons then you’ll get the corresponding sound of the drum. And in addition you can also use the keys on the keyboard to have a sound effect.

Have more fun....
